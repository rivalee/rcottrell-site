Hello! I'm an image-maker, storyteller and designer. I graduated from the Royal College of Art in 2019.</p>

<p>
I'm interested in natural laws and how they can be used to write stories, and using humour and strange situations to create a certain feeling. My RCA project focused on <a href="https://rcottrell.com/2019/03/07/fly-patisserie.html">a fly who dies in every story</a>, with every story lasting six panels long.

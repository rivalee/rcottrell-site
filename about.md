I'm an illustrator, comic artist and interaction designer presently living in London. I graduated from the Royal College of Art in 2019. I also hold a BA in graphic design from Reading University and a MSc in human-computer interaction from University College London. I have no plans to obtain any more degrees.

I'm interested in natural laws and how they can be used to write stories, and how they affect (or predict) our response to them. My MA project was inspired by my interest in natural laws: see [emergent comic strip](../emergent-comic-strip).

I also make all kinds of [images](illustration) and am [open to exchanging images in return for money](mailto: r.e.cottrell@gmail.com).

**Swatted** was my MA project at the RCA: a series of seven short comics about a fly who dies in every story. Although it sounds depressing, we can focus on the optimistic message that he's alive at the beginning of every new story.


## Flies

I chose a fly as my main character. As Ken Hollings has said, "all cartoon characters are based on animals you wouldn't want inside your house".

We struggle with flies in human spaces. We find them disgusting, they have a reputation of spreading diseases, and they’re constantly in conflict with human beings.

The stories document the relationship we have with flies in humorous and tragic ways, from the perspective of the fly. They portray the fly character as being joyful and incredibly enthusiastic about being alive, whether investigating a rotting fruit bowl or a fresh eclair, contributing pathos to the ending of each story.

## Rules and gaps

The comics use rules to structure the story, and the death of the fly is determined by chance: a die roll has determined the position in the story in which the fly dies, and the narrative is structured around it. Other rules determine the length of the story (six panels long) and the fly’s personality. The drama in the stories mainly comes from the contrast between the conflicting goals of the fly and the human (or the human’s pets, the proxy human). Although the fly dies in every story, the human cannot ultimately win: flies always find a way to get inside the house.

Rules shape behaviour and outcome. A gap between rules (the absence of a rule, something that is left undefined) is an opportunity for emergence. An emergent comic strip uses a computational approach to authoring a story, where a human plays the role of a computer following a program.

An emergent comic strip uses rules to structure and partially define stories. In Swatted, each story has the same tragic outcome: the protagonist dies at some point in the six-frame story. An aspect of chance shapes the story: the length of the fly’s life, already very short over a maximum of six panels, is controlled by a dice roll. How the protagonist dies isn’t defined, and a different story emerges each time within the structure of the rules, and from within the spaces.

Character rules determine how the character responds to the world around it, drama comes from characters with strongly opposite goals. In this case, the conflict is between a fly and the human spaces it inhabits. The tragedy of the stories, in which the fly inevitably dies, is heightened by the joyful, optimistic, and likeable character of the fly.  

1. Six panel stories
2. The fly dies in every story
3. A roll of the die determines the point at which the fly dies
4. The fly is always relentlessly optimistic despite the circumstances
5. The fly appears to be refined despite his true status
6. Often a second story is happening in the background
7. The primary voice is the fly, who always speaks directly to the camera
8. After the fly's death, there is silence, though events may still be occurring

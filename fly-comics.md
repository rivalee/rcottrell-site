<p>Swatted is a series of short comics about a fly who dies in every story, created during my RCA MA.</p>


<p>I chose a fly as my main character. We struggle with flies in human spaces: we find them disgusting, they have a reputation of spreading diseases, and theyâ€™re constantly in conflict with human beings, making them ideal for driving story conflict.</p>

<h2>Rules and gaps</h2>

<p>
Rules shape behaviour and outcome, and a missing rule (something undefined) is an opportunity for emergence. An emergent comic strip uses a computational approach to authoring a story, where a human plays the role of a computer following a program: with the fleshy, flawed ability to iterate on a storyline in a way computers cannot.</p>


<ol>
<li>Six panel stories</li>
<li>The fly dies in every story</li>
<li>A roll of the die determines the point at which the fly dies</li>
<li>The fly is always relentlessly optimistic despite the circumstances</li>
<li>The fly appears to be refined despite his true status</li>
<li>Often a second story is happening in the background</li>
<li>The primary voice is the fly, who always speaks directly to the camera</li>
<li>After the fly's death, there is silence, though events may still be occurring</li>
</ol>
